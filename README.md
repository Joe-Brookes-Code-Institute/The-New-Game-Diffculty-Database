## What's is The-Game-Diffculty-Database

The Game Difficulty Database is a platform designed to provide detailed information about the difficulty settings of various games. It helps players understand how different difficulty levels affect gameplay and overall experience.
- - -

## Why

Many games lack detailed descriptions of their difficulty settings, often providing only vague statements. This database aims to fill that gap by offering comprehensive rundowns and opinions on optimal settings, enhancing players' overall enjoyment and helping them make informed decisions.

|       Dante Must Die difficulty is only available for    |
|       players who have beaten the game on both Devil     |
|       Hunter and Son of Sparda difficulties. However,    |
|       for players on the PS5 and Series X versions, it   |
|       can be unlocked simply by beating the game once    |
|       on Legendary Dark Knight. This difficulty setting  |
|       is generally aimed at players playing on New Game  |
|       Plus who have already maxed out their character    |
|       data. It includes rearranged enemies who are both  |
|       more intelligent, more aggressive, and can take    |
|       more damage.                                       |
|                                                         |
|       While this could be irritating in some genres,     |
|       I would say that Devil May Cry does a good job of  |
|       handling it due to the game's focus on combos,     |
|       tricks, and dealing a large amount of damage to    |
|       individual enemies without taking a single hit.    |
|       As a result, I don't feel that the increased enemy |
|       health detracts from the core pillars of the game. |
|                                                         |
|       If there is one major flaw to Dante Must Die       |
|       difficulty, it's that the game's health and life   |
|       system is still very exploitable. Players can      |
|       easily spam gold orbs, and to make things      |
|       worse, there is a pay-to-win system where players  |
|       can pay real money to come back to life in the     |
|       game. This somewhat hurts my ability to recommend  |
|       this as a good difficulty setting, although in     |
|       most other ways, it's a solid and unexpected       |
|       inclusion.                                         |
|                                                         |

## Nice Extras & Other Interesting Tools

[Chrome Extension Spell Checker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webpage-spell-check/mgdhaoimpabdhmacaclbbjddhngchjik) - I love to use this both on my site and to check over my README before submission, as its easy to get spelling errors creeping into your project as you burn the midnight oil towards the end as your deadline is looming.

[Chrome Exension WAVE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh) - WAVE is a web accessibility evaluation tool developed by [WebAIM.org](https://wave.webaim.org/). It provides visual feedback about the accessibility of your web content by injecting icons and indicators into your page. No automated tool can tell you if your page is accessible, but WAVE facilitates human evaluation and educates about accessibility issues. All analysis is done entirely within the Chrome browser allowing secure valuation of intranet, local, password protected, and other sensitive web pages. I believe there is also an extension for Firefox.

[Web Disability Simulator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla) - A fantastic chrome extension that allows you to simulate how certain disabilities can affect the users experience of your site. Really useful if you're using colour to represent a result - for example in a quiz.
