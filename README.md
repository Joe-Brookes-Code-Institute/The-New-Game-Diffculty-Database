## What's is The-Game-Diffculty-Database

The Game Difficulty Database is a platform designed to provide detailed information about the difficulty settings of various games. It helps players understand how different difficulty levels affect gameplay and overall experience.
- - -

## Why

Many games lack detailed descriptions of their difficulty settings, often providing only vague statements. This database aims to fill that gap by offering comprehensive rundowns and opinions on optimal settings, enhancing players' overall enjoyment and helping them make informed decisions.

## Early User Experience Design

Submit Game Information: Add details about game difficulty settings.

Search Functionality: Find games based on various difficulty features and settings.
This feature only ended up going as far as basic name searching.

This is an early mockup of the planned look on a mobile phone.

|       Dante Must Die difficulty is only available for    |
|       players who have beaten the game on both Devil     |
|       Hunter and Son of Sparda difficulties. However,    |
|       for players on the PS5 and Series X versions, it   |
|       can be unlocked simply by beating the game once    |
|       on Legendary Dark Knight. This difficulty setting  |
|       is generally aimed at players playing on New Game  |
|       Plus who have already maxed out their character    |
|       data. It includes rearranged enemies who are both  |
|       more intelligent, more aggressive, and can take    |
|       more damage.                                       |
|                                                         |
|       While this could be irritating in some genres,     |
|       I would say that Devil May Cry does a good job of  |
|       handling it due to the game's focus on combos,     |
|       tricks, and dealing a large amount of damage to    |
|       individual enemies without taking a single hit.    |
|       As a result, I don't feel that the increased enemy |
|       health detracts from the core pillars of the game. |
|                                                         |
|       If there is one major flaw to Dante Must Die       |
|       difficulty, it's that the game's health and life   |
|       system is still very exploitable. Players can      |
|       easily spam gold orbs, and to make things      |
|       worse, there is a pay-to-win system where players  |
|       can pay real money to come back to life in the     |
|       game. This somewhat hurts my ability to recommend  |
|       this as a good difficulty setting, although in     |
|       most other ways, it's a solid and unexpected       |
|       inclusion.                                         |
|                                                         |

### Testing/User Experience Design
# Functional Testing

Functional testing was conducted to verify that the site works as intended. This involved:

Checking all links to ensure they lead to the correct pages

Verifying that the game submission form correctly adds new entries to the database

Testing the search functionality to confirm it returns accurate results

Ensuring that user authentication (login, logout, registration) functions properly

Verifying that game details are displayed correctly on individual game pages

# Non-Functional Testing

Non-functional testing was performed to assess the quality of the user experience. This included:

Evaluating the site's responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes

Assessing the loading speed of pages and images

Checking the intuitive nature of the user interface

Evaluating the visual appeal and consistency of the design

Testing the site's accessibility features



# User Interface Testing
Verify all links and buttons function correctly.
Test responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes.
Ensure forms validate input correctly and display appropriate error messages.
CRUD Functionality Testing
Create: Test adding new game entries to the database.

Read: Verify that game listings and detail pages display correctly.
Update: Test editing existing game entries.
Delete: Ensure game entries can be removed from the database.
User Authentication Testing

Test user registration process.
Verify login and logout functionality.
Ensure proper access control for authenticated and non-authenticated users.

W3S was used to test the HTML and CSS
They all seemed to pass validation.
